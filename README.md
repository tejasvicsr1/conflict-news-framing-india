# Conflict Frames in Indian Election News Coverage

This repository contains the data and code used for analyzing the use of conflict frames in online news articles published by seven major news outlets during the 2014 and 2019 Indian general elections. Our study explores the portrayal of contentious or adversarial events and issues in election reporting and examines several key findings:

- **Media Outlet Analysis**: The study investigates the relationship between conflict frames and the ideological biases of media outlets. Our results indicate that the use of conflict frames in Indian online media is not influenced by the media outlets' ideological leanings. Instead, TV-based media are more likely to employ conflict frames compared to print-based media.
- **Portrayal of Parties**: Contrary to expectations, the majority of news outlets do not show ideological bias in depicting political parties as aggressors or targets within conflict frames.
- **Substantive Issues**: We find a consistent underreporting of substantive electoral issues such as farmers' concerns and infrastructure, while mentions of opposition parties are frequently reported.

## Repository Contents

- **Data**: Datasets containing the news articles analyzed for conflict frames, along with metadata on publication source, date, and type of media (TV-based or print-based).
- **Code**: Scripts for data processing, conflict frame detection, and statistical analysis.
- **Results**: Detailed findings on the prevalence of conflict frames, their association with media types, and the portrayal of political parties.

## Usage

Researchers and analysts can use this repository to replicate our study or extend the analysis to other election cycles or regions. The code is organized to facilitate easy modification and adaptation for similar research.
